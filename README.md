# Pointillism Image Generator

This Python script transforms regular images into pointillist-style artworks using the Pygame library. It creates scaled-up versions of input images, rendering them with a collection of colored dots in the style of pointillism.

## Features

- Scales up input images
- Applies pointillism effect using red, green, and blue dots
- Randomizes dot placement for a more natural look
- Supports various dot shapes (circles, squares, rectangles)
- Outputs a new image file with the pointillist effect applied

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Testing

- Go to cmd in your desktop
- Go to the file location
- Type "python pointillism.py" as the command prompt
- I am also attaching the resulted image in this respiratory (check out the image file named "result")
